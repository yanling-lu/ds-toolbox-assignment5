Definition: git status

The git status command is useful for knowing the status of your project by tracking the different changes to files being worked on. It will tell you which branch you are on, whether your repositary has been updated from the remote server, and whether there are any local changes that need to be staged, committed, and/or pushed. It gives you a status check to see if everything is up to date and matching locally and on the remote server. 

To access the same information on the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, you first click on the column on the far left the Git symbol. This symbol should be the third one from the top. Once accessed, stay on the "Changes" tab. The different sections on this "Changes" tab will give you similar information to the $ git status command on terminal - for example on the top right corner of that panel any orange dots indicates that at least one change has been made, so either a push or pull to GitHub is required. The panel will also identify what repository and branch one is working on. Additoinally, the panel also shows what files have have been changed, which changes have been staged, and what files are untracked - all similar alerts to what the $ git status terminal command would show us.
